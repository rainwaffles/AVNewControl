	 * gyro_bias_dot = 0

	 *		[-P[1][1]				   ,  Q_gyro]
	 * 
	 * This is multiplied by DT and added to P.
	 *
	 * The second equation from the Kalman paper is as follows:
	 *
	 *	  P = P - K C P
	 *
	 * Dimensionally:
	 *
	 *	  P<2,2> -= K<2,1> C<1,2> P<2,2>
	 *
	 * We first compute t<1,2> = C P.
	 * 
	 * Since C is [1, 0], t[0] = C[0] * P[0][0] ( + C[1] * P[1][0] = 0) = P[0][0]
	 * and				t[1] = C[0] * P[0][1] ( + C[1] * P[1][1] = 0) = P[0][1]
	 *
	 * We then multiply t by K0 and subtract the result from P.
